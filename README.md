# serial_read_matlab
Used with a UART to analyze adc values and FFT results in MatLab

I built this code with the purpose of aiding with debug for another project where I'm using the MSP432P401R to record ADC values and 
then performing FFT on those values. This code graphs plots the data and allows me to see the data at certain points as well.
